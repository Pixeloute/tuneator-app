## Integration

- Import only the services/types you need in your feature modules or API routes.
- Extend or replace in-memory logic with persistent storage or cloud services as needed.
- All modules are designed to be easily testable and composable.

# Enterprise Infrastructure Plan

A new `infrastructure/` directory will be created under `src/enterprise/` to house foundational services for sharded database architecture and encryption. This is part of Phase 1 of the enterprise implementation plan.
